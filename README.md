Description
===========
Kangaroo strikes while driving are a common occurrence in Australia, especially in the ACT.

This tool makes it easier to report incidents to the local wildlife authority, and potentially save the injured animal. It makes it easy to collect and send:
- a photo of the wounded animal
- your current GPS coordinates
- the time of the incident

The above allows more efficient collection of better quality data, which helps local councils plan for and mitigate the impact of wildlife collisions. It helps volunteer organisations provide better animal welfare services, and could also be used to provide real-time road conditions for other road users.
